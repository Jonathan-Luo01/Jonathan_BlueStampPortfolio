Hi! I'm Jonathan. My project is the Computer Vision Security Camera. This project uses a Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless and an USB Camera to detect moving objects and alert the user. Python and openCV is used to detect objects in the video feed and when movement is detected, two emails will be sent. The initial email contains a photo of the object, while the next email contains a twenty-scond short video. I used the libraries pyaudio, wave, threading, and fmmpeg to sync the audio and video. The user can also choose to view the live video feed of the security camera if the Raspberry Pi and their personal device is connected to the same network.
