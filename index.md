# Mini Cat Lamp
This project uses a simple circuit which was soldered together to create a mini cat that has an LED on its back that lights up when it becomes dark. In this project, I learned how to properly use tools for soldering and apply what I learned to a real-life creation.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was to completely assemble the Mini Cat Lamp by combining both the cat body circuit board and the base. Soldering the cat's arms to its torso, I inserted the cat body into the gold tabs in the base. I inserted the standoffs needed to keep the base upright into the sides and soldered each part together. Then, I inserted a battery into the bottom of the base. Finally, when the switch was turned on, the Mini Cat Lamp's LED light would turn on when it turned dark. Through this project, I learned how to solder and how an electrical circuit worked.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was assembling the base of the Mini Cat Lamp. I soldered the battery holder and switch into the base. It was imporant to pay attention to the orientation of each part to prevent soldering them on incorrectly, since desoldering the parts would be tedious. I was surprised at how the soldering iron would also melt the plastic circuit board, and so I tried to minimize the time taken to finish soldering.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was completely assembling the cat body board. I inserted the LED, transistor, resistor, and photoresistor into the cat body board. Then, I proceeded to use the soldering iron to solder each of these parts into the board. At first, I was unfamiliar with soldering, and so the initial soldering was messy, requiring me to clean up the solder left outside the pins. When the solder cooled, I snipped off the extra wires extending from the parts. The most important part was the photoresistor, which would limit the electricity flow if light was detected. After completing this, I would need to assemble the base of the Mini Cat Lamp.
